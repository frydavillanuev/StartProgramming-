<h1>How to start programming</h1>

<p>I am gonna give you some advice on how to start programming. </p> 

<P>Before you start learning a program language, inform yourself what the program is use for, and if it works for whatever you want to make as a programmer. There are programs to make websites, games, apps, and so much more.</p>

<p>when you have done this, start to learn the program you chose, a lot of people will recommend you to start easy so you can understand a harder program later with the knowledge you gained with the easy programming language. You might want to listen to them, because if you start the hard way, you might loose a lot of time trying to figure out things, not knowing nothing about programming will make it harder for you to understand the language and when you look for help it might be the same, trying to figure out what are they saying, or what are you reading to find the answer to your confusion. </p>

<p>So, after you decided which language you want to start with, start by looking for tutorial on YouTube. There are also a lot of webpages that will teach you this programming language. I am gonna list some links to webpages that have a lot of info about different programming languages. There are web pages made just for an specific language that you want to learn, and they give a lot of info and teach you how to use the programming language. Try not to skipped the videos, because you might loose important info and remember you are new to all of this, you need to know all the info you can get. The same goes with reading , DO NOT SKIPPED PAGES OR LINES!. </p>

<p>When you start watching tutorials, or reading them. Make sure you download the app you are going to use to start practicing what are you learning in the process. There are a lot of apps that are made for an specific programming language, and others that support multiple languages.</p> 

<p>My best advice it's that whatever language you chose to start with, stick with it until you learn it very well, do not be changing program after program, if you think the program you chose its too hard change it, but try not to do this constantly, because at the end you will not know a program as its fullest. This is why people recommend to start the easy way.</p> 

<p>Start learning a new program until you feel comfortable with the one you were learning, be patient learning this programs.</p>

<p>Create things with the program you learned, DO NOT JUST LEARN IT!!!. Make the time you spend learning it, worth it. Do not be afraid to show your work. We all start low and as we go we get higher and better, as the times goes and you learn new things, you will have more knowledge and probably create better things.</p> 

<p>Create a project from starch and stick with it until you finish it. Do not be creating a project after project, cause the same goes here, at the end you will have nothing done. So, create an idea, write what you want to accomplished, and do it. I don't want to limit you on your projects but what a I am trying to say it's that, whenever you start a project try to finish it, it might take time, and you might get bored and start a new project but never leave the other project behind. At least your first project try to finish it, so you know how comfortable you are with the program you learn. After you are done learning a program, create a project to know how much you learned, and to use your knowledge.</p>

<p>To show your work, or to work with other people on the same project GITHUB it is the best website to do this, watch a tutorial to learn it, and use it. You can put your work there, and other people will see it, and might want to help you. There people also post problem they have and you can solve them if you can. Like I said show your work.</p>
