Html it is use to create web sites, you create the website's body with it, mosly ust the scripted part, and it might look ugly to you, but that it's the first step, then you will learn new languagues to give more live to your website, like CSS and JavaScript. you might mot want ot be a web developer and you want to learn something else, then do that, a lot of people recomends to learn python, it is the easies type of languague as well, it is very different form html, butit is one of the most use languague around the world. Never start from the hardest languague because it migth take a lot of yout time to understand it, and you will loose time. Try to concentrate in one langua at the time, because it is gona be hard to concenrate in a lot of them at the same time and you might getthings confuse. decide foe one langugue and sttick with it, until you feel comfortable with it, it doesnt ,atter how much time it takes you, but it is better if you go to the next one until you really now one for sure. </p>

Inform yourself about the apps programmers use or how they work, so you know a little more about the flow they have, do not be afraid to show you work juts because its not as goos as other ones, we all started there, and thebest things it is that first app, game, or wepag ewe created because, it took use time, love and all you can think of to make it. so be proud of your work. If you have the oppurtunity to work with people, do it because you might learn new things from them and they are gonna learn from you as well, and also if you have question and this person has more expirience, they can help you.  </p>
